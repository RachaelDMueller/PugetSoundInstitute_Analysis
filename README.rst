Salish Sea Model analysis at Puget Sound Institute 
************************
This repository contains a collection of post-processing files designed to create tables, graphics, and movies from Salish Sea Model output. This post-processing system relies on a `.yaml` configuration file for organizing file paths (as well as other information) and a `shapefile` that provides information for each model node (e.g. depth, region name, etc).  See `Project Contributors`_ for a list of those who have contributed to this system and `Cookbook`_ for recipes on how to use the files in this repository to cook up graphics, tables, and movies.
