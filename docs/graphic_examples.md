# Salish Sea Model output graphics 
These are some simple graphics that I created to help develop a sense of baseline values and differences.  Most of these graphics were created for the purpose of internal use and learning.  

Please reference this repository if used.

Overview of 2014 Conditions
---
These graphics show the median, min, and max values for temperature (celcius), salinity(ppt), and dissolved oxygen (mg/l).  I binned the values to help accentuate regional characteristics.  The graphics were created in [plot_2014_ref_stats.ipynb](https://github.com/RachaelDMueller/SalishSeaModel-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/plot_2014_ref_stats.ipynb).

Time series of median Net Primary Productivity (NPP) across embayments
---
Three panel graphic for Bellingham Bay, Sinclair Inlet, and Case Inlet showing the median Net Primary productivity across three inlets, comparing 2014 nitrogen loading conditions to pre-industrial loading conditions (same physical environment), with grey shading in between to highlight the difference.

Time series of median physical characteristics across embayments
---
These time series show temperature ($^o$C, temp), salinity (ppt), and sea surface height (m, zeta). Light shades show hourly output while darker shades show 24-hour running averages.  
Graphics for Bellingham Bay, Sinclair Inlet, and Case Inlet were created in the [plot_TS_inlets_NPP_workshop_12062022 notebook](https://github.com/RachaelDMueller/SalishSeaModel-analysis/blob/main/NPP_workshop_120622/plot_TS_inlets_NPP_workshop_12062022.ipynb).

Time series of median biophyical characteristics across embayments
---
These time series show Nitrate and Nitrite (mg/l, NO3), salinity (ppt), Photosynthetically Available Radiation (Einstein/meters^2/day, PAR), Net Primary Productivity (gC/m^2/day, NPP), and Disolved Oxygen (mg/l, DOXG). Light shades show hourly output while darker shades show 24-hour running averages.
