* Sukyong Yun <sukyong.yun@pnnl.gov> (Provided Salish Sea Model run output, an understanding of output file structure, and insight to post-processing methods.)
* Ben Roberts <bedaro@uw.edu> (Shared knowledge on Salish Sea Model output forma and inspired the method of using a shapefile to organize model information and to plot output.  Provided code for converting Salish Sea Model output files to netcdf.)
* Kevin Bogue <kbogue13@uw.edu> (Created the shapefiles.)

A special thanks to Doug Latornell in Susan Allen's lab at the University of British Columbia for generously sharing his knowledge on how to `create a good working environment`_ to support academic code developement.
