This project was led by `Stefano Mazzilli`_, `Joel Baker`_, and `Tarang Khangaonkar`_ 
at the University of Washington's `Puget Sound Institute`_ and `PNNL`_. 

The following people have contributed to code development:

* Rachael Mueller <RachaelDMueller@gmail.com> (development lead for creating this SalishSeaModel post-processing system, the code, and the repository.  Rachael also setup and ran some of the model results evaluated here.)
* Sukyong Yun <sukyong.yun@pnnl.gov> (Provided Salish Sea Model run output, an understanding of output file structure, and insight to post-processing methods.)
* Ben Roberts <bedaro@uw.edu> (Shared knowledge on Salish Sea Model output forma and inspired the method of using a shapefile to organize model information and to plot output.  Provided code for converting Salish Sea Model output files to netcdf (see `ssmhist2netcdf`_.)
* Kevin Bogue <kbogue13@uw.edu> (Created the shapefiles. The shapefile used in this work is version controled in `SalishSeaModel-grid`_).

A special thanks to Doug Latornell in Susan Allen's lab at the University of British Columbia for generously sharing his knowledge on how to `create a good working environment`_ to support academic code developement.
