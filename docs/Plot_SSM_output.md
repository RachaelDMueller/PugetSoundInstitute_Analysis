## A description of a method for plotting Salish Sea Model output
The version of the model plotted here is  `FVCOM_ICM_v2` (See [model history](https://ssmc-uw.org/salish-sea-modeling-center/salish-sea-model/history/) for more information)
This method was shared by Ben Roberts and relies on shapefiles that contain polygon structures for SSM nodes. These shapefiles were cloned from Ben's Git repository.
