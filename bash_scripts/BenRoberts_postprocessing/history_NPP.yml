# A basic config file to extracting information from SSM history files. The
# more variables you uncomment, the longer the extraction will take.
#
# Index integers are the zero-indexed order of the blocks in the history
# file at each time.
#
# Within each index, the only required key is "variable" which names the
# NetCDF output variable. The optional keys "per_layer" and "per_time"
# can each be set to false to specify that these variables do not change
# along the given dimension; they will be skipped after the first
# opportunity to read them, and the NetCDF variable will be appropriately
# dimensioned. All other keys are added as attributes to the NetCDF
# variable.
